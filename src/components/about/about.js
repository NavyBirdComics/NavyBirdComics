      Won't you like to know something about me? I was born as a bird, centuries ago, on a pirate's ship. Or perhaps on a planet, by a distant star! Though what does it matter? I make art and comics now. So enjoy my attempts at fantastical crafts, with larger-than-life people, monsters and the such. I've done some work, oh yes,  like several short comics, a WIP comics anthology, and a few failed attempts, though I'd rather not mention them by name. Anyways, welcome to my wonderland, hope you enjoy your stay.
